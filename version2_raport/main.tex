\begin{Summary}
Using a QR-based attendance app in schools and universities has become a practical way to streamline how attendance is managed. This kind of system offers a solid, all-in-one solution for teachers, making it easy to check if students are present without needing paper forms or manual tracking.

It gives teachers quick access to up-to-date attendance records and insights into student participation. For the system to run smoothly and securely, it relies on modern tech like centralized data storage, easy-to-use mobile apps, and dependable QR code scanning. These features help prevent fraud and make the whole process more efficient.

The goal of this project is to build and roll out a smart mobile app that solves the usual problems with traditional attendance tracking. With a simple QR scan, students can check in, and the system takes care of the rest. The app also includes advanced analytics tools that can be tailored to the needs of different departments, helping improve teaching efficiency and cut down on admin work.

On top of that, it supports better learning outcomes and helps keep students accountable by making it easier to track who’s really showing up and taking part in class.

\section{Introduction}

\indent Over the past few decades, technology and communication have come a long way, bringing big changes to just about every field—including education. These days, schools and universities are expected to make the most of modern tools to improve how they operate, both on the admin side and in the classroom. One of the key areas where this really matters is tracking student attendance, which says a lot about how engaged and committed students are.

Even though attendance is so important, a lot of schools still use old-school methods like calling out names or having students sign in on paper. These approaches take up time and can easily lead to mistakes—or even be misused. As student numbers grow and programs become more varied, there's a real need for faster, more reliable ways to handle attendance. That’s where QR code technology comes in. By letting students scan a code with their phones to mark themselves present, this system makes the whole process quicker and more accurate. It’s a simple change that can make a big difference in how efficiently schools run.

\section{Problem Statement}
As student numbers grow and academic activities diversify, traditional attendance methods have become a burden for both teachers and administrators. Manually verifying each student's presence requires significant time, reducing the time available for instructional activities. Additionally, paper-based attendance records can be lost or damaged, and data manipulation is possible, such as students signing in on behalf of absent classmates. Manually collecting and analyzing attendance data also requires considerable effort and may delay the issuance of essential administrative reports.


\subsection{Traditional Attendance Tracking Systems}
Historically, educational institutions have relied on conventional methods for recording student attendance, which often involve direct human intervention. Despite their simplicity, these systems have become inefficient in the digital age, lacking reliability and effectiveness. The following table summarizes the most common traditional methods along with their advantages and disadvantages:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Traditional Attendance Tracking Methods}
\label{tab:traditional-attendance}
\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Advantages} & \textbf{Disadvantages} \\
\hline
Manual Attendance Recording Using Paper Lists & 
Simple implementation; No technology required; Familiar to most teachers & 
Time-consuming; Susceptible to forgery; Risk of damage/loss; Difficult to digitize \\
\hline
Handwritten Signatures & 
Quick distribution method; Creates physical record; No teacher time used & 
Easy to forge; Distracts students during class; Difficult to verify authenticity \\
\hline
Verbal Roll Call & 
Direct verification of presence; Helps teacher learn student names & 
Impractical for large classes; Causes delays; No digital records \\
\hline
Administrative Attendance Recording & 
Reduces teacher workload; Standardized record-keeping & 
Requires additional staff; No direct student interaction; Lacks flexibility \\
\hline
\multicolumn{3}{|p{13cm}|}{\textbf{General Problems:} Human error; No unified digital records; Delayed reporting; Weak security and privacy} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\vspace{7cm}

These limitations of traditional systems highlight the need for modern digital solutions that can address these challenges effectively while providing enhanced security and efficiency.

Using QR Code technology is an ideal option to achieve this goal, as it allows students to register their attendance by scanning a quick-response code with their smartphones, with the data being automatically stored in a central database accessible to both administrators and teachers.

Based on the above, the main research problem can be formulated as follows:
\begin{quote}
\textbf{How can a mobile application based on QR Code technology be designed and developed to enable students to register their attendance in a secure and fast manner, ensuring data accuracy and ease of use for both students and administration?}
\end{quote}


\section{Existing Solutions}
This section focuses on collecting comprehensive data regarding existing attendance monitoring systems. By examining and evaluating these systems, we aim to develop a thorough understanding of the requirements, allowing us to create a streamlined solution that resolves the majority of issues present in the current framework. Our research incorporates documented models from previous records and current implementations to ensure we address all aspects of the topic while maintaining a structured and methodical approach to our investigation.

\subsection{Student Attendance Monitoring System - Mohammed Al-Siddiq Ben Yahya University, Jijel}
This Android-based smart application allows instructors to track student attendance through QR code technology~\cite{rayane2022}, creating a user-friendly experience. The system comes in two distinct versions:
The instructor portal offers comprehensive functionality, including historical session data access, real-time attendance management, progress tracking, note-taking capabilities, and student communication tools. Meanwhile, the student version provides a simplified experience focused exclusively on attendance registration through the QR scanning feature.
It's important to note that while the instructor version has been fully implemented with all planned features, the student version currently only supports the basic attendance marking function. The application features multiple intuitive interfaces designed to enhance usability for all users. However, the current method — where the instructor scans QR codes displayed on students' devices — has proven to be impractical and time-consuming, especially for large classes, limiting the application's overall efficiency.
Some of the interfaces are presented below.

\section{Proposed Solution}
To address the identified problem, this project proposes designing and developing a mobile application that allows students to register their attendance by scanning a unique QR Code assigned to each class using their smartphones. The QR code is pre-generated. Upon entering the classroom, the student scans the code from the teacher device, and their attendance is automatically recorded in a central database.

The system ensures the accuracy of entered data and prevents any attempts at manipulation by automatically recording the time and date of attendance. Students can only register their attendance when physically present in the designated location. Moreover, the system allows teachers to access real-time attendance data. The system's user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy for all users to interact with it without requiring advanced technical skills.

This solution streamlines attendance tracking by reducing time and effort, improving accuracy, and enabling quick access to student data, ultimately enhancing educational management.

\section{Objectives}
This project aims to achieve a set of key objectives that contribute to improving the student attendance process and enhancing the performance of educational processes. These objectives include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Facilitating the attendance recording process:} By automating the attendance process using QR Code technology, teachers can efficiently record student presence without manual effort, reducing administrative workload and freeing up more time for teaching.
    \item \textbf{Ensuring the accuracy of attendance data:} Through the digital system, the likelihood of human errors or data manipulation is minimized, as the time and date of attendance are recorded automatically and accurately.
    \item \textbf{Enhancing the efficiency of educational processes:} By providing a centralized database that allows teachers to access and analyze attendance data at any time, facilitating the preparation of reports and supporting quick and informed decision-making.
    \item \textbf{Ensuring security and privacy:} The system is designed to maintain the confidentiality of student data and prevent unauthorized access, enhancing user trust and ensuring compliance with security standards.
\end{itemize}
\section{Conclusion}
In summary, the proposed mobile attendance tracking system based on QR Code technology presents a modern and effective solution to the limitations of traditional attendance methods. By automating the attendance process and centralizing data management, the system ensures greater accuracy, saves time, and enhances administrative efficiency within educational institutions. 

Through a detailed analysis of existing systems and the identification of key challenges, this project outlines a practical and scalable approach that meets the needs of both students and academic staff. The integration of user-friendly interfaces and secure data handling mechanisms further contributes to the system's reliability and ease of adoption.

This work not only supports the ongoing digital transformation in the education sector but also lays the groundwork for future enhancements, such as integration with learning management systems (LMS), advanced analytics, and geolocation-based verification. Ultimately, the implementation of this system has the potential to significantly improve the quality of educational services and foster a more efficient, transparent, and tech-savvy academic environment.

\subsection{Introduction}
In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the development of software systems has become a cornerstone of innovation across virtually every sector. From healthcare and education to logistics and finance, robust and scalable software solutions are essential for addressing complex problems and enhancing operational efficiency. In this context, designing and implementing an effective software system requires a structured and well-informed approach that bridges user needs with technical execution.

This section focuses on the foundational aspects of software conception as applied to the development of a QR Code-based attendance tracking system. The primary goal of this system is to streamline and secure the process of recording student attendance through the integration of mobile technologies and real-time data processing. To achieve this, a strong emphasis is placed on applying proven software engineering principles and modeling practices.

The following sections explore the general concepts underlying software design, with particular attention to object-oriented methodologies and the Unified Modeling Language (UML)~\cite{omg2017}. These approaches provide a systematic framework for translating functional requirements into a coherent software architecture that supports maintainability, scalability, and ease of use.


\subsection{Introduction to Software Conception}
Software conception is an essential step in the software development lifecycle. It occurs between requirements analysis and the coding phase, and constitutes a fundamental transition between what the software should do and how it will do it. This step allows for defining the global architecture of the system, its components, the interfaces between them, and the technological choices to adopt. The main objective is to design a software solution that is robust, efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain.

According to Ian Sommerville in \textit{Software Engineering} (10\textsuperscript{th} edition), good design should respect principles such as modularity, separation of concerns, low coupling between modules, and high internal cohesion~\cite{sommerville2015}. These principles facilitate code reuse, testing, maintenance, and reduce the risk of errors during development.

Pressman and Maxim, in their reference work \textit{Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach}, emphasize the importance of object-oriented design, which models the system as a collection of objects interacting via messages, more accurately representing the reality of the application world~\cite{pressman2014}.

\subsection{Software Conception Models}
Before detailing the UML language, it is important to note that there are several approaches and software design models that allow representing the functioning of a system. Among the most well-known, we can cite:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Waterfall model}: a sequential approach where each phase of development must be completed before moving on to the next ~\cite{royce1970}.
  \item \textbf{The Spiral model}: based on an iterative and incremental approach integrating risk analysis ~\cite{boehm1988}.
  \item \textbf{The Agile model}: an iterative and evolutionary method centered on collaboration, frequent deliverables, and continuous adaptation to needs ~\cite{beck2001, cockburn2002}.
  \item \textbf{Object-oriented design}: it consists of modeling a system in terms of objects, classes, and interactions, approaching the way we perceive the real world ~\cite{booch1994, gamma1995}.
\end{itemize}

These models influence the choice of modeling tools. For this project, we opted for object-oriented design and the use of UML language due to its expressive richness, international standardization \cite{omg2017}, and widespread adoption in industrial and academic projects \cite{rumbaugh2004, fowler2004}.


\subsection{Definition of UML (Unified Modeling Language)}

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized graphical language for modeling software systems, representing their structure, behavior, and interactions. Developed in the mid-1990s by Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, and Ivar Jacobson—known as "the Three Amigos"—it was standardized by the Object Management Group (OMG) in 1997~\cite{omg2017}, unifying several object-oriented modeling methods~\cite{pressman2014}. Version 2.5.1 (2017) defines 14 diagram types in three main categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item Structural diagrams (e.g., class diagram, component diagram, object diagram, package diagram, deployment diagram, composite structure diagram, profile diagram),
\item Behavioral diagrams (e.g., activity diagram, state diagram, use case diagram),
\item Interaction diagrams (e.g., sequence diagram, communication diagram, timing diagram, interaction overview diagram).
\end{itemize}
Each UML diagram plays a specific role in the software development lifecycle; for instance, class diagrams show a system’s static structure, while sequence diagrams illustrate dynamic interactions~\cite{sommerville2015}. This multi-view modeling aids in comprehending complex systems.

UML enhances communication among developers, analysts, and clients, and improves documentation~\cite{omg2017}. As Sommerville states, "UML has become the standard language for describing and documenting object-oriented systems"~\cite{sommerville2015}.

Its flexibility suits both plan-driven and agile methods, with lightweight UML used in agile for essential communication, and detailed modeling in formal processes~\cite{pressman2014}. UML also includes the Object Constraint Language (OCL) and profiles to support diverse domains like real-time and enterprise systems~\cite{omg2017}.

Despite its complexity, UML remains a core tool in software engineering, providing a standardized visual language across languages and platforms~\cite{sommerville2015}.

\subsection{Introduction}
To better understand, design, and communicate the structure and behavior of the attendance tracking system, we employ Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams. UML provides a standardized visual notation that aids both technical and non-technical stakeholders in grasping system components and interactions. The following subsections present three essential UML diagrams : use case diagram, class diagram, activity diagram and sequence diagram ,each focusing on a different aspect of the system's design.

\subsection{Use Case Diagram}
The use case diagram illustrates the core functionalities of the student attendance system from the perspective of its primary users. It highlights the external \textit{actors} and \textit{use cases}, offering a clear view of how users interact with the system and what operations they can perform ~\cite{fowler2004}.

\textbf{Main Actors :}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{teacher}, who is responsible for generating QR codes for each session, monitoring student attendance, and viewing class details.
\item The \textbf{student}, who scans the QR code to mark their presence, views their attendance history, and can submit an excuse in case of absence.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{ Some use Cases :}
\begin{itemize}
\item Authentication (Teacher , Student),
\item QR code generation and scanning (Teacher),
\item Attendance monitoring and viewing (Teacher),
\item Absence justification submission (Student).
\end{itemize}

The use case diagram illustrating these interactions is shown right below.

    \label{fig:attendance-system}
\end{figure}

\vspace{9,5cm}
\newline
This diagram offers an overview of system functionalities, understandable even by non-technical users~\cite{fowler2004}.

\subsection{Class Diagram}
The class diagram is a structural diagram that describes the system's object classes, their attributes, operations, and the relationships (associations, inheritances, dependencies) between them ~\cite{fowler2004}.

\subsection{Activity Diagram}
The activity diagram models the workflow of a business process. It allows representing the different steps, decisions, parallelisms, and conditions of a business or software process~\cite{fowler2004}.

\textbf{Example of Role-Based Access Scenario:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The user opens the application,
\item They enter their credentials,
\item The system authenticates the user,
\item The system checks the user’s role (e.g., Teacher, Student, or No Role),
\item If no role is found, the user is redirected to the login screen,
\item If the user is a Teacher:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Teacher Role Guard verifies their access,
\item If authorized, they access the Teacher Features,
\item If unauthorized, they are redirected to the login screen,
\end{itemize}
\item If the user is a Student:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Student Role Guard verifies their access,
\item If authorized, they access the Student Features,
\item If unauthorized, they are redirected to the login screen.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
This diagram allows optimizing interactions and identifying bottlenecks~\cite{arlow2005}.

The activity diagrams are shown right below.

\subsection{Sequence Diagram}

A sequence diagram is a type of interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order. It visually represents the sequence of messages exchanged between different entities (objects or components) in a specific time sequence, focusing on the flow of logic within a system~\cite{booch2005uml}
.







\textbf{Example of Attendance System Workflow:}

The sequence diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a live session in the attendance system. The key phases are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Profile Loading \& State Management:}  
    The \textit{Student} and \textit{TeacherClient} initialize by querying the profile tables. Once the data is received, the respective notifiers update the state to \texttt{LOADED} or \texttt{ACTIVE}.
    
    \item \textbf{Live Session Initialization:}  
    The client connects using a session ID and subscribes to both the live sessions and attendance records channels through the \textit{LiveSessionSocket}. Upon success, the state changes to \texttt{IN\_SESSION}.
    
    \item \textbf{Attendance Recording Flow:}  
    The student submits attendance, which inserts a record into the database. A PostgreSQL trigger streams the update, and real-time session stats are updated in parallel, along with the profile's attendance state.
    
    \item \textbf{Group Management:}  
    The teacher can switch between groups, triggering a query for attendance data. Filtered results are returned and used to update the group view.
    
    \item \textbf{Session Cleanup:}  
    The client disconnects and unsubscribes from the channels. The session state is reset to \texttt{ACTIVE}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, understanding software conception and its associated models is fundamental to developing reliable, maintainable, and scalable systems. The transition from abstract requirements to concrete implementation begins with a well-thought-out design phase, guided by principles such as modularity, cohesion, and low coupling. Among various modeling paradigms, object-oriented design stands out for its alignment with real-world abstractions and its ability to efficiently structure complex systems.

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) thus played a central role in ensuring clarity, consistency, and effective communication throughout the development process. By leveraging these models, this project laid a solid foundation for the implementation of a robust and user-friendly attendance system based on QR code technology.

In this project, several UML diagrams were employed to design and visualize the QR Code-based attendance tracking system. The \textit{use case diagram} clarified the core functionalities from the users’ perspectives. The \textit{class diagram} outlined the system's structural components and their relationships. The \textit{sequence diagram} captured the dynamic interactions during a live attendance session, and the \textit{activity diagram} modeled the workflow for access control and session participation. Together, these diagrams offered a comprehensive understanding of both the static and dynamic aspects of the system.

This project was part of a broader effort to modernize the education system by creating a mobile app that lets students check in using QR codes. It was designed to fix the common issues with old-school attendance methods, which are often slow, easy to mess up, and open to cheating.

The app makes attendance tracking quick, reliable, and secure by automating the process through QR code scanning. All data gets saved in a real-time database that teachers and administrators can access anytime. This setup not only saves time but also helps keep things transparent and keeps students accountable.

Among the key achievements of the project:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implementation of an intuitive interface tailored to different user roles (teacher, student).
  \item Automatic recording of timestamped data to prevent manipulation.
  \item Integration of analytical tools to monitor attendance and absence patterns.
\end{itemize}

The app isn't just for universities—it's flexible enough to be used in other schools or even workplaces that need to keep close tabs on attendance.

That said, there are some limitations. The system assumes every student has a working smartphone and a steady internet connection when checking in. And since it relies only on QR codes for verification, there's a chance it could be misused without extra security like GPS or fingerprint checks.

Looking ahead, here are a few ideas to make the system even better:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS) for a comprehensive student tracking ecosystem.
  \item Add location tracking to make sure students are actually in class when they check in.
  \item Development of an advanced administrative dashboard for detailed attendance analytics.
\end{itemize}

All in all, this project is a big step toward smarter, more automated attendance tracking in schools. It shows how mobile tech and smart software design can help make education more efficient and reliable.
