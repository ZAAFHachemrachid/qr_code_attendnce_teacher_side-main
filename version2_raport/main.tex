\section{Introduction}

\indent In recent decades, the world has witnessed tremendous advancements in technology and communication, leading to fundamental changes across various sectors, including education. Today, educational institutions are required to leverage modern technologies to enhance their performance and streamline both administrative and academic processes. Among these essential tasks is tracking students' attendance, which serves as a key indicator of their commitment and engagement with their studies.

Despite its importance, many educational institutions still rely on traditional attendance methods such as manual name recording or paper-based sign-in sheets. These methods are time-consuming and prone to human errors or manipulation. With the increasing number of students and the diversity of academic programs, it has become essential to develop digital solutions that expedite this process and improve its accuracy. In this context, the use of QR (Quick Response) Code technology has emerged as an innovative solution, allowing students to register their attendance by simply scanning a unique code with their smartphones. This not only saves time but also ensures the accuracy of attendance data, thereby contributing to the overall efficiency of the educational process.

\section{Problem Statement}
As student numbers grow and academic activities diversify, traditional attendance methods have become a burden for both teachers and administrators. Manually verifying each student's presence requires significant time, reducing the time available for instructional activities. Additionally, paper-based attendance records can be lost or damaged, and data manipulation is possible, such as students signing in on behalf of absent classmates. Manually collecting and analyzing attendance data also requires considerable effort and may delay the issuance of essential administrative reports.


\subsection{Traditional Attendance Tracking Systems}
Historically, educational institutions have relied on conventional methods for recording student attendance, which often involve direct human intervention. Despite their simplicity, these systems have become inefficient in the digital age, lacking reliability and effectiveness. The following table summarizes the most common traditional methods along with their advantages and disadvantages:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Traditional Attendance Tracking Methods}
\label{tab:traditional-attendance}
\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Advantages} & \textbf{Disadvantages} \\
\hline
Manual Attendance Recording Using Paper Lists & 
Simple implementation; No technology required; Familiar to most teachers & 
Time-consuming; Susceptible to forgery; Risk of damage/loss; Difficult to digitize \\
\hline
Handwritten Signatures & 
Quick distribution method; Creates physical record; No teacher time used & 
Easy to forge; Distracts students during class; Difficult to verify authenticity \\
\hline

Requires additional staff; No direct student interaction; Lacks flexibility \\
\hline
\multicolumn{3}{|p{13cm}|}{\textbf{General Problems:} Human error; No unified digital records; Delayed reporting; Weak security and privacy} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\vspace{7cm}

These limitations of traditional systems highlight the need for modern digital solutions that can address these challenges effectively while providing enhanced security and efficiency.

Using QR Code technology is an ideal option to achieve this goal, as it allows students to register their attendance by scanning a quick-response code with their smartphones, with the data being automatically stored in a central database accessible to both administrators and teachers.

Based on the above, the main research problem can be formulated as follows:
\begin{quote}
\textbf{How can a mobile application based on QR Code technology be designed and developed to enable students to register their attendance in a secure and fast manner, ensuring data accuracy and ease of use for both students and administration?}
\end{quote}


\section{Existing Solutions}
This section focuses on collecting comprehensive data regarding existing attendance monitoring systems. By examining and evaluating these systems, we aim to develop a thorough understanding of the requirements, allowing us to create a streamlined solution that resolves the majority of issues present in the current framework. Our research incorporates documented models from previous records and current implementations to ensure we address all aspects of the topic while maintaining a structured and methodical approach to our investigation.

\subsection{Student Attendance Monitoring System - Mohammed Al-Siddiq Ben Yahya University, Jijel}
This Android-based smart application allows instructors to track student attendance through QR code technology~\cite{rayane2022}, creating a user-friendly experience. The system comes in two distinct versions:
The instructor portal offers comprehensive functionality, including historical session data access, real-time attendance management, progress tracking, note-taking capabilities, and student communication tools. Meanwhile, the student version provides a simplified experience focused exclusively on attendance registration through the QR scanning feature.
It's important to note that while the instructor version has been fully implemented with all planned features, the student version currently only supports the basic attendance marking function. The application features multiple intuitive interfaces designed to enhance usability for all users. However, the current method — where the instructor scans QR codes displayed on students' devices — has proven to be impractical and time-consuming, especially for large classes, limiting the application's overall efficiency.
Some of the interfaces are presented below.

\section{Proposed Solution}
To address the identified problem, this project proposes designing and developing a mobile application that allows students to register their attendance by scanning a unique QR Code assigned to each class using their smartphones. The QR code is pre-generated. Upon entering the classroom, the student scans the code from the teacher device, and their attendance is automatically recorded in a central database.

The system ensures the accuracy of entered data and prevents any attempts at manipulation by automatically recording the time and date of attendance. Students can only register their attendance when physically present in the designated location. Moreover, the system allows teachers to access real-time attendance data. The system's user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy for all users to interact with it without requiring advanced technical skills.

This solution streamlines attendance tracking by reducing time and effort, improving accuracy, and enabling quick access to student data, ultimately enhancing educational management.

\section{Objectives}
This project aims to achieve a set of key objectives that contribute to improving the student attendance process and enhancing the performance of educational processes. These objectives include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Facilitating the attendance recording process:} By automating the attendance process using QR Code technology, teachers can efficiently record student presence without manual effort, reducing administrative workload and freeing up more time for teaching.
    \item \textbf{Ensuring the accuracy of attendance data:} Through the digital system, the likelihood of human errors or data manipulation is minimized, as the time and date of attendance are recorded automatically and accurately.
    \item \textbf{Enhancing the efficiency of educational processes:} By providing a centralized database that allows teachers to access and analyze attendance data at any time, facilitating the preparation of reports and supporting quick and informed decision-making.
    \item \textbf{Ensuring security and privacy:} The system is designed to maintain the confidentiality of student data and prevent unauthorized access, enhancing user trust and ensuring compliance with security standards.
\end{itemize}
\section{Conclusion}
In summary, the proposed mobile attendance tracking system based on QR Code technology presents a modern and effective solution to the limitations of traditional attendance methods. By automating the attendance process and centralizing data management, the system ensures greater accuracy, saves time, and enhances administrative efficiency within educational institutions. 

Through a detailed analysis of existing systems and the identification of key challenges, this project outlines a practical and scalable approach that meets the needs of both students and academic staff. The integration of user-friendly interfaces and secure data handling mechanisms further contributes to the system's reliability and ease of adoption.

This work not only supports the ongoing digital transformation in the education sector but also lays the groundwork for future enhancements, such as integration with learning management systems (LMS), advanced analytics, and geolocation-based verification. Ultimately, the implementation of this system has the potential to significantly improve the quality of educational services and foster a more efficient, transparent, and tech-savvy academic environment.

\subsection{Introduction}
In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the development of software systems has become a cornerstone of innovation across virtually every sector. From healthcare and education to logistics and finance, robust and scalable software solutions are essential for addressing complex problems and enhancing operational efficiency. In this context, designing and implementing an effective software system requires a structured and well-informed approach that bridges user needs with technical execution.

This section focuses on the foundational aspects of software conception as applied to the development of a QR Code-based attendance tracking system. The primary goal of this system is to streamline and secure the process of recording student attendance through the integration of mobile technologies and real-time data processing. To achieve this, a strong emphasis is placed on applying proven software engineering principles and modeling practices.

The following sections explore the general concepts underlying software design, with particular attention to object-oriented methodologies and the Unified Modeling Language (UML)~\cite{omg2017}. These approaches provide a systematic framework for translating functional requirements into a coherent software architecture that supports maintainability, scalability, and ease of use.


\subsection{Introduction to Software Conception}
Software conception is an essential step in the software development lifecycle. It occurs between requirements analysis and the coding phase, and constitutes a fundamental transition between what the software should do and how it will do it. This step allows for defining the global architecture of the system, its components, the interfaces between them, and the technological choices to adopt. The main objective is to design a software solution that is robust, efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain.

According to Ian Sommerville in \textit{Software Engineering} (10\textsuperscript{th} edition), good design should respect principles such as modularity, separation of concerns, low coupling between modules, and high internal cohesion~\cite{sommerville2015}. These principles facilitate code reuse, testing, maintenance, and reduce the risk of errors during development.

Pressman and Maxim, in their reference work \textit{Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach}, emphasize the importance of object-oriented design, which models the system as a collection of objects interacting via messages, more accurately representing the reality of the application world~\cite{pressman2014}.

\subsection{Software Conception Models}
Before detailing the UML language, it is important to note that there are several approaches and software design models that allow representing the functioning of a system. Among the most well-known, we can cite:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Waterfall model}: a sequential approach where each phase of development must be completed before moving on to the next ~\cite{royce1970}.
  \item \textbf{The Spiral model}: based on an iterative and incremental approach integrating risk analysis ~\cite{boehm1988}.
  \item \textbf{The Agile model}: an iterative and evolutionary method centered on collaboration, frequent deliverables, and continuous adaptation to needs ~\cite{beck2001, cockburn2002}.
  \item \textbf{Object-oriented design}: it consists of modeling a system in terms of objects, classes, and interactions, approaching the way we perceive the real world ~\cite{booch1994, gamma1995}.
\end{itemize}

These models influence the choice of modeling tools. For this project, we opted for object-oriented design and the use of UML language due to its expressive richness, international standardization \cite{omg2017}, and widespread adoption in industrial and academic projects \cite{rumbaugh2004, fowler2004}.


\subsection{Definition of UML (Unified Modeling Language)}
The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized graphical language used for modeling software systems. It offers a set of standardized notations allowing visual representation of different views of a system: static structure, dynamic behavior, interactions, use cases, etc.
Initially designed by Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, and Ivar Jacobson (often referred to as "the Three Amigos") at Rational Software in the mid-1990s, UML was standardized by the OMG (Object Management Group) in 1997~\cite{omg2017}. UML emerged as a unification of several object-oriented modeling approaches that were prevalent during that period, creating a common visual language for software developers worldwide~\cite{pressman2014}.
UML version 2.5.1, released in 2017, includes 14 types of diagrams divided into three major categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item Structural diagrams (e.g., class diagram, component diagram, object diagram, package diagram, deployment diagram, composite structure diagram, profile diagram),
\item Behavioral diagrams (e.g., activity diagram, state diagram, use case diagram),
\item Interaction diagrams (e.g., sequence diagram, communication diagram, timing diagram, interaction overview diagram).
\end{itemize}
Each diagram type serves a specific purpose in the software development lifecycle. For instance, class diagrams represent the static structure of a system by showing classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships, while sequence diagrams illustrate the dynamic interactions between objects over time~\cite{sommerville2015}. This multi-perspective approach enables comprehensive modeling of complex software systems from different viewpoints.
UML promotes shared understanding among stakeholders (developers, analysts, clients, etc.) and improves system documentation~\cite{omg2017}. As noted by Sommerville, "UML has become the standard language for describing and documenting object-oriented systems"~\cite{sommerville2015}. Its widespread adoption across the software industry has established it as a lingua franca for software architects and developers.
The flexibility of UML allows it to be used in various software development methodologies, from traditional plan-driven approaches to agile methods. In agile contexts, lightweight UML modeling often focuses on select diagram types to communicate essential system aspects without excessive documentation overhead~\cite{pressman2014}. Conversely, in more formal development environments, UML can be applied rigorously to produce detailed system specifications.
Beyond its core diagramming capabilities, UML also supports model-driven development through the Object Constraint Language (OCL) and various profile extensions that adapt UML to specific domains or platforms. These extensions enhance UML's utility across diverse application domains, including real-time systems, web applications, and enterprise software~\cite{omg2017}.
Despite criticisms regarding its complexity and learning curve, UML remains a cornerstone of software engineering education and practice, providing a standardized visual vocabulary that transcends programming languages and implementation technologies~\cite{sommerville2015}.

\subsection{Introduction}
To better understand, design, and communicate the structure and behavior of the attendance tracking system, we employ Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams. UML provides a standardized visual notation that aids both technical and non-technical stakeholders in grasping system components and interactions. The following subsections present three essential UML diagrams : use case diagram, class diagram, activity diagram and sequence diagram ,each focusing on a different aspect of the system's design.

\subsection{Use Case Diagram}
The use case diagram illustrates the core functionalities of the student attendance system from the perspective of its primary users. It highlights the external \textit{actors} and \textit{use cases}, offering a clear view of how users interact with the system and what operations they can perform ~\cite{fowler2004}.

\textbf{Main Actors :}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{teacher}, who is responsible for generating QR codes for each session, monitoring student attendance, and viewing class details.
\item The \textbf{student}, who scans the QR code to mark their presence, views their attendance history, and can submit an excuse in case of absence.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{ Some use Cases :}

This diagram offers an overview of system functionalities, understandable even by non-technical users~\cite{fowler2004}.

\subsection{Class Diagram}
The class diagram is a structural diagram that describes the system's object classes, their attributes, operations, and the relationships (associations, inheritances, dependencies) between them ~\cite{fowler2004}.

\textbf{Examples of Classes:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Profile}: id, first\_name, last\_name, role, phone,
  \item \texttt{Student\_Profile}: id, profile\_id, student\_group\_id, student\_id,
  \item \texttt{Teacher\_Profile}: id, profile\_id, department\_id, employee\_id,
  \item \texttt{Session}: id, schedule\_id, start\_time, end\_time, status,
  \item \texttt{Attendance}: id, session\_id, student\_id, timestamp, status.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Activity Diagram}
The activity diagram models the workflow of a business process. It allows representing the different steps, decisions, parallelisms, and conditions of a business or software process~\cite{fowler2004}.

\textbf{Example of Role-Based Access Scenario:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The user opens the application,
\item They enter their credentials,
\item The system authenticates the user,
\item The system checks the user’s role (e.g., Teacher, Student, or No Role),
\item If no role is found, the user is redirected to the login screen,
\item If the user is a Teacher:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Teacher Role Guard verifies their access,
\item If authorized, they access the Teacher Features,
\item If unauthorized, they are redirected to the login screen,
\end{itemize}
\item If the user is a Student:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Student Role Guard verifies their access,
\item If authorized, they access the Student Features,
\item If unauthorized, they are redirected to the login screen.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
This diagram allows optimizing interactions and identifying bottlenecks~\cite{arlow2005}.

The activity diagrams are shown right below.

\newpage
\subsection{Sequence Diagram}

A sequence diagram is a type of interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order. It visually represents the sequence of messages exchanged between different entities (objects or components) in a specific time sequence, focusing on the flow of logic within a system~\cite{booch2005uml}
.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/morsli/sequence.png}
    \caption{Sequence Diagram}
    \label{fig:attendance-system}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Example of Attendance System Workflow:}

The sequence diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a live session in the attendance system. The key phases are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Profile Loading \& State Management:}  
    The \textit{Student} and \textit{TeacherClient} initialize by querying the profile tables. Once the data is received, the respective notifiers update the state to \texttt{LOADED} or \texttt{ACTIVE}.
    
    \item \textbf{Live Session Initialization:}  
    The client connects using a session ID and subscribes to both the live sessions and attendance records channels through the \textit{LiveSessionSocket}. Upon success, the state changes to \texttt{IN\_SESSION}.
    
    \item \textbf{Attendance Recording Flow:}  
    The student submits attendance, which inserts a record into the database. A PostgreSQL trigger streams the update, and real-time session stats are updated in parallel, along with the profile's attendance state.
    
    \item \textbf{Group Management:}  
    The teacher can switch between groups, triggering a query for attendance data. Filtered results are returned and used to update the group view.
    
    \item \textbf{Session Cleanup:}  
    The client disconnects and unsubscribes from the channels. The session state is reset to \texttt{ACTIVE}.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, understanding software conception and its associated models is fundamental to developing reliable, maintainable, and scalable systems. The transition from abstract requirements to concrete implementation begins with a well-thought-out design phase, guided by principles such as modularity, cohesion, and low coupling. Among various modeling paradigms, object-oriented design stands out for its alignment with real-world abstractions and its ability to efficiently structure complex systems.

In this project, several UML diagrams were employed to design and visualize the QR Code-based attendance tracking system. The \textit{use case diagram} clarified the core functionalities from the users’ perspectives. The \textit{class diagram} outlined the system's structural components and their relationships. The \textit{sequence diagram} captured the dynamic interactions during a live attendance session, and the \textit{activity diagram} modeled the workflow for access control and session participation. Together, these diagrams offered a comprehensive understanding of both the static and dynamic aspects of the system.

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) thus played a central role in ensuring clarity, consistency, and effective communication throughout the development process. By leveraging these models, this project laid a solid foundation for the implementation of a robust and user-friendly attendance system based on QR code technology.

This project was part of the digital transformation of the educational system through the design and development of a mobile application that enables student attendance tracking using QR code technology. The application addresses many of the shortcomings of traditional attendance methods, which are often inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to human error or fraud.

The developed application provides a reliable, fast, and secure solution for recording attendance by automating the process via QR code scanning and storing the data in a centralized, real-time database accessible by both teachers and administrators. This approach not only saves time but also promotes transparency and student accountability.

Among the key achievements of the project:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implementation of an intuitive interface tailored to different user roles (teacher, student).
  \item Automatic recording of timestamped data to prevent manipulation.
  \item Integration of analytical tools to monitor attendance and absence patterns.
\end{itemize}

The potential applications of this solution extend beyond universities. It can be adapted to other educational or professional settings requiring rigorous attendance management.

However, the system has some limitations. It assumes that students have functioning smartphones and a stable internet connection when scanning the QR code. Moreover, relying solely on code scanning for authentication could be bypassed without additional verification mechanisms such as geolocation or biometric checks.

For future improvements, several directions can be considered:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS) for a comprehensive student tracking ecosystem.
  \item Addition of geolocation to verify the student's physical presence in the classroom.
  \item Development of an advanced administrative dashboard for detailed attendance analytics.
\end{itemize}

In conclusion, this project marks a significant step toward intelligent and automated attendance management in educational institutions. It demonstrates our concrete contribution to enhancing academic processes by combining mobile technology, structured software modeling, and innovative educational practices.
